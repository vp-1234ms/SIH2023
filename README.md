# üìù Description <a name = "description"></a>

Motion Amplification video (MAV) is a technique for visualizing and measuring vibration of structures and machinery. This processes a video clip of an object, extracts feature that are moving from frame to frame, then amplifies and replays the motion in each frame. Defects at micro scales are rendered visible. Vibration amplitudes and mode shape can be thereafter be determined. Time waveform and FFT spectrum can also be captured. This would be extremely useful in evaluating noise, vibration and shock on various platforms. It is also useful in automobile, power plants, industry and other engineering sectors.
